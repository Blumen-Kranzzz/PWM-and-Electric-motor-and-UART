2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-11#1 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance UART0/UART0/o_pulse2 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance UART0/UART0/o_pulse0.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.944 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.967 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.971 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[7]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.975 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.983 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.984 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.988 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[5]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -22.988 ns between UART0/UART0/o_pulse2/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and UART0/UART0/UART_Tx0/data_i_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rst relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on i_rx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on PWM relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on o_tx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
